# CodeUpdate-0031A - Server Smoke Test Compile Fix

This update is a corrective build-fix patch for CodeUpdate-0031.

## Fixed

- Corrected the configuration smoke-test JSON string in `Tests/Source/Reforged.Core.Tests/Program.cs`.
- The previous CodeUpdate-0031 file contained unescaped JSON quotes inside a normal C# string literal, causing GitHub Actions to fail with `Syntax error, ',' expected` at `Program.cs#L59`.

## Boundaries

- No gameplay systems are added.
- No combat is added.
- No character creation is added.
- No world simulation loop is added.
- No networking expansion is added.
- No live editor implementation is added.

## Verification

- GitHub truth was read before creating this patch.
- The user-provided GitHub Actions failure output was matched to the current GitHub file.
- The update ZIP was verified for one top-level folder, BAT installer, manifest, and patch-only payload before delivery.
- The ChatGPT packaging container does not include the .NET SDK, so local restore/build/test could not be run here.
- GitHub Actions remains the official validation gate after the user applies, commits, and pushes this update.
